## How confident do you feel with the content on arrays so far?

I feel very confident with the basics of arrays. I've used them quite a bit in Java, and although some of the formatting an methods are different, the same general principles seem to apply.

## Is there any additional leanring you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

None that I can think of currently. Obviously, there are a lot more methods that can be used on arrays that I don't currently know.

## What questions do you have about arrays?

None currently.
